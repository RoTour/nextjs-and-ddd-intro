Implementing a safe Domain Event parsing strategy is essential when integrating Bounded Contexts, especially to ensure that the consuming system remains decoupled from the originating system's internal model and that data integrity is maintained. This strategy relies heavily on the **Published Language** pattern and defensive translation tools.

Drawing on the sources, here are the key strategies for designing a safe Domain Event parsing approach:

### 1. Standardizing the Contract (Published Language)

The first step in safe parsing is establishing a clear, standardized data contract for the Events being exchanged.

*   **Define a Custom Contract:** The safest way to define a reliable contract is by using a **standards-based approach** that forms a **Published Language (PL)**, such as defining a **custom media type**. This specification defines the binding contract between producers and consumers.
*   **Avoid Sharing Binaries:** The consumer should explicitly **avoid deploying the interfaces and class binaries** of the Domain Event objects from the producing context. Sharing binary classes introduces the danger of using foreign objects freely, which risks violating the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
*   **Focus on Data Properties:** The contract ensures that the consuming Bounded Context is interested only in the **data properties** conveyed by the contract. The consuming context should never be tempted to use functionality or terminology that is part of a different model.
*   **Event Structure:** The notification specification should define standard parts, such as the `notificationId` (unique identity), `typeName` (fully qualified class name of the event), `version`, and `occurredOn` date/time. The actual Event payload resides within an `event` details field, typically structured as JSON or XML.

### 2. Utilizing a Safe Parsing Mechanism (`NotificationReader`)

To safely consume and interpret the standardized contract without introducing foreign dependencies, a specialized reading tool should be used, typically within the Anticorruption Layer (ACL).

*   **Dynamic Typing Approach:** Instead of static deserialization, consuming events often employs a **dynamic typing approach**. This involves using a tool, such as a `NotificationReader`, which consumes the serialized representation (e.g., JSON).
*   **Property Navigation:** The `NotificationReader` provides methods to access attributes using **XPath-like syntax** or **dot-separated properties**. This allows the consumer to read attribute values as specific primitive types (like `int`, `long`, or `String`).
*   **Type Safety and Decoupling:** This approach eliminates the need for Event and Value Object types to be deployed to the consuming subscribers. This is considered elegant and liberating by some, as it ensures that the local domain model remains decoupled from the specific implementation details of the Event class.
*   **Event Enrichment:** The Event payload itself must be rich enough to supply all the data necessary for the subscriber to take action, including **Value Objects**. This is known as **Event Enrichment**, which ensures subscribers avoid needing to query back to the originating Aggregate.

### 3. Handling Evolution and Delivery Safety

A robust parsing strategy must also account for the evolution of the event model (versioning) and the unreliability of messaging systems.

| Safety Concern | Implementation Strategy | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Versioning and Evolution** | Events must include a **version number**. The consumer can key off this version to safely parse the specialized attributes of the event, allowing most consumers to avoid recompilation if they only need version 1 compatibility. It is wise to choose a serializer (like Protocol Buffers) that favors versioning. | |
| **ACL Translation** | The parsing logic sits within an **Anticorruption Layer (ACL)**, which translates the foreign contract data into **local types** defined by the consuming contextâ€™s Ubiquitous Language. This ensures foreign concepts never contaminate the local domain model. | |
| **Chronological Ordering** | Events must be **applied in chronological order** (oldest first) to ensure the changes affected on the local model are correct. This is particularly critical when consuming RESTful notification logs, where notifications are guaranteed to be delivered in the order they were appended to the Event Store. | |
| **De-Duplication (Idempotence)** | If using messaging middleware that guarantees "at-least-once" delivery, the receiver must be designed to be **idempotent**. If domain object idempotence is not possible, the receiver must track the unique message ID (notification identity) of all handled messages to prevent reprocessing duplicates. This handled message tracking must be committed along with any changes to the local domain model state. | |

### Summary of Implementation Placement

The parsing and consumption logic (the specialized strategy) should be placed in the consuming Bounded Context, specifically within the **Infrastructure Layer** or the **Application Layer**, serving as an **Anticorruption Layer**. The parsing mechanism itself is usually implemented in a component like the **Adapter** (e.g., `IdentityAccessNotificationAdapter`), which uses the `NotificationReader` to convert the Published Language into local domain concepts.
